# FastText Word Embedding Alignment using Procrustes and Unsupervised CSLS

This repository demonstrates techniques for aligning word embeddings between English and Hindi using:

- **Supervised Procrustes Alignment**
- **Unsupervised Adversarial Training with CSLS** (based on [Facebook's MUSE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE))

The experimental code has been given at `assignment.ipynb` with detailed explanation of each step.

The code in this repository uses pre-trained models and datasets that are publicly available and governed by their respective open-source licenses. All rights and credits for these datasets, tools, and models belong to their original creators and maintainers. This repository simply integrates them for demonstration purposes.
